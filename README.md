# WP 3D Pony

`WP 3D Pony` is a wordpress plugin to show a 3D MLP:FiM(My Little Pony) pony on your website. It's based on [Live2dWidget.js](https://l2dwidget.js.org) and [Frash's Pony Model](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=578539741). 

## Installation

	cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/
	git clone https://github.com/juzeon/wp-3d-pony wp-3d-pony
	
The activate it on your wordpress dashboard.

You can also download [this](https://github.com/juzeon/wp-3d-pony/archive/master.zip) ZIP file and extract it to the directory where plugins stored. But remember to rename the directory from `wp-3d-pony-master` to `wp-3d-pony` before activation!
